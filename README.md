# bike-sharing-rental-analysis case study

This project uses data from a ficticious bike rental company PhillyCycle. 
The company would like to know what factors 
most affect bike rentals per hour.

The columns names of the dataset are:


• record_number - unique record number for each observation

• datetime - hourly date + timestamp

• season-1=Winter,2=Spring,3=Summer,4=Fall

• holiday - whether the day is considered a holiday

• weather - 1 = Clear to Partly Cloudy, 2 = Mist, 3 = Precipitation (rain or snow)

• temp - temperature in Celsius

• humidity - relative humidity (0% to 100%)

• windspeed - wind speed in miles per hour

• casual - number of non-registered user rentals initiated in a given hour

• registered - number of registered user rentals initiated in a given hour

• all_users - number of total rentals initiated in a given hour
